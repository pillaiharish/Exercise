    "# How to Create an ARIMA Model for Time Series Forecasting in Python\n",
    "- ARIMA is an acronym that stands for AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average.\n",
    "- An autoregressive integrated moving average, or ARIMA, is a statistical analysis model that uses time series data to either better understand the data set or to predict future trends. "

    "- AR: Autoregression. A model that uses the dependent relationship between an observation and some number of lagged observations.\n",
    "- I: Integrated. The use of differencing of raw observations (e.g. subtracting an observation from an observation at the previous time step) in order to make the time series stationary.\n",
    "- MA: Moving Average. A model that uses the dependency between an observation and a residual error from a moving average model applied to lagged observations."

    "- The data is prepared by a degree of differencing in order to make it stationary, i.e. to remove trend and seasonal structures that negatively affect the regression model.\n",
    "- A value of 0 can be used for a parameter, which indicates to not use that element of the model. \n",
    "- This way, the ARIMA model can be configured to perform the function of an ARMA model, and even a simple AR, I, or MA model."
