A)first make a repo in github manually
B)configure the device using ssh. go to settings in github and paste the rsa(or any encryption file contents) to ssh and gpg keys, add to ssh keys.

$ ssh -T git@github.com
if no clone command used then initialize the folder on local for git.
$ git init 

$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "harishpillai1994@gmail.com"

after the above command you would get a file on your local folder, with the paraphrase used earlier just open with notepad, copy the entire content to mentioned in step(B)

C) create a repo in github or 
D) create repo in local then commit to github

for step(C)
1)create github repo manually in github/your_profilename 
2)clone the repo on local
$ git clone https://github.com/pillaiharish/Exercise

3)then create files required, then 'add' to local repo of git, 'commit' them locally then use 'git push'. For 'push' you need origin reference to the remote(server) location of the master
$  git remote add origin https://github.com/pillaiharish/

$  git add datacamp/
$  git commit
$  git push -u origin master

###############deletion######################
Since git is a distributed VCS, your local repository contains all of the information. No downloading is necessary; you just need to extract the content you want from the repo at your fingertips.

If you haven't committed the deletion, just check out the files from your current commit:

$ git checkout HEAD <path>

If you have committed the deletion, you need to check out the files from a commit that has them. Presumably it would be the previous commit:

$ git checkout HEAD^ <path>

but if it's n commits ago, use HEAD~n, or simply fire up gitk, find the SHA1 of the appropriate commit, and paste it in.

other git commands
$ git pull
$ git log
$ git status
$ eval $(ssh-agent -s)
$ ssh-add -l
$ git remote -v
$ git checkout git_win/git_initial
